                <p>Welcome! The purpose of this website is to provide you with a valuable aid that will give you an advantage in the immensely popular computer game "DOTA 2." We'll achieve this by teaching you how to use our timer, which is a very simple device. Just press "start" at the right time, and listen for the alerts that will inform you when to take action.</p>

                <p>There's an instruction page that will teach you how to use the timer and explain its value. If you're very tech savvy, you can jump to the timer page. If you've been playing DOTA for very long, the timer's purpose should be very obvious: it will remind you to check runes, kill Roshan, and so on.</p>

                <p>If you browse the rest of this website, you'll see that I also offer miniature news updates which help to keep you informed about what's going on in the DOTA world. And if you love the timer and you're feeling generous, or if you have any comments or requests to send my way, please see the contact page. </p>
